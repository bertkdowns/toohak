OK, this time i'm actually gonna do this properly.
Server logic in the server, host and client is "dumb", and most importantly, JSON for sending data.
Still gonna use the host and client's css etc.

Also, I want to make the server auto download/setup a quiz from kahoot as the quiz, rather than preparing them 
beforehand. Why not just use kahoot? 10 player limit right now, plus "A LEARNING Experience" or whatever. Also,
then I can display questions and answers on device (if playing remotely)

The idea is to host it on my raspi when done at letsgo.hs.vc - this will also require me eventually implementing 
WSS - websocket secure. Shouldn't be too hard tho.

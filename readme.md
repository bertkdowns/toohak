Basic kahoot clone I made during lockdown (2020, first year of university). Nice and simple, raw html and js, using nodejs for the backend and websockets for communication.

usage:

	node server.js

then setup a basic http server to serve the static files (python

	cd static
	python -m http.server

go to the http port and check it out!
